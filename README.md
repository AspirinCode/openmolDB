## About

OpenMolDB is open source chemical database/inventory.
It supports substructure and similarity search and filtering by properties. 
Have a look at [demo](http://www.samoturk.info). 

This project wouldn't be possible without these excellent open source projects:
* Django - Python web framework, which is a base for OpenMolDB
* OpenBabel/pybel - chemistry toolkit with python bindings
* jQuery - javascript library
* ChemDoodle Web - javascript chemical library, which handles the displayand drawing of chemical structures
* Flot - jQuery plugin for plotting
* Foundation - CSS style
* Font Awesome

## What does not work

* Structure editor and viewer do not work in IE 8 and older
* Structure editor is not rendered properly in Chrome
